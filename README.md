I don't know if I will ever use this.
I made this because I wanted to make a suggestion on the mozilla page but seriously not interested in going through this much effort with little to no potential return. 
I do not have confidence my comment will be handled but instead expect backlog.
I will leave this account here for now, we'll see what happens.
and then Git Hub wants me to pick a plan...
and now I am on some mailing lists and spam...
I know it started out as good intentions but marketing and churn have turned it into a mortgage plan and it's not appealing to the end user.
